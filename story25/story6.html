        It was a dark night and was raining from time to time.Gusts of wind
        shook the trees. There were strange noises and in between the
        thunderclaps the moaning of jackals could be heard.Flashes of lightning
        revealed fearsome faces and there were strange and mysterious laughter
        of the spirits. But inspite of such a weird atmosphere king Vikramaditya
        did not swerve a bit. He climbed the ancient tree to bring the corpse
        down and soon he began crossing the desolate cremation ground, with the
        corpse lying on his shoulder. The Betaal that possessed the corpse
        spoke: "O King , I pity you as you are making untiring efforts without
        relaxing as if you wish to achieve something.Instead of enjoying a
        comfortable sleep on a cozy bed, you're still coming after me. You seem
        to be quite adamant. Such arrogance may not help you keep your promise
        if you had given one to anybody. You'll realize the futility of the
        whole thing if only you listen to my story." The Betaal then narrated
        this story.The ruler of Kishanagar, Rajendra, was extremely strong and
        courageous. He was a good ruler and cared about his people very much as
        he would not do anything unjust. His subjects were happy and contented.
        They had no problems. His queen, Prema, gave birth to a beautiful
        daughter, Sona. Being an only child, Sona enjoyed a lot of freedom and
        was brought up like a boy. She grew up clever not only in studies but in
        the use of the bow and arrow and sword. She learnt the art of
        self-defence. When she reached marriageable age, her parents began
        searching for a suitable husband for her. But Sona disagreed to their
        proposal as she had some definite ideas and views. She said to her
        parents that ,"Dear Father, I want that my husband should be one who is
        highly skilled in fighting and who is able to overpower, me in fight.
        Suppose if our kingdom face an enemy in the future, he should be able to
        fight & defeat them in war. If you agree to this condition then, you may
        make an announcement". The King & Queen were very proud to hear about
        their daughter's thoughts.The announcement was made in Kishanagar as
        well as in the neighbouring kingdoms. Thinking that Sona is only a
        girl,and it should not be a difficult to win a fight with her, many
        suitors came forward to accept her challenge as they also knew that Sona
        being the only heir they would have complete sway over the kingdom once
        they married her. But when they (the suitors) met Sona face to face
        these princes realized it was not that easy to defeat her. Everyone of
        them was routed by Sona, and they had to go back disappointed. She was
        taking on the suitors one after another, among them was Udayavarma, the
        prince of Chandanghar. He watched the fight every day , by joining the
        crowd. He carefully watched how Princess Sona fought and the different
        strategies she adopted to meet the method of fighting followed by each
        prince. One day, he could not control himself when he saw a particular
        way she used the sword. He got up and shouted "Bravo!" in appreciation
        and encouragement. Sona turned to look at him, wondering who he might be
        who could understand the intricacies of each and every stance and step
        during the fight. But among such a large crowd she could only get a
        glimpse of him. By now Udayavarma had learnt all her strategies, and the
        next day he was ready to fight with her. The two fought cleverly and
        fiercely. Neither of them was prepared to surrender to the other. During
        her fight Sona tried all her tricks, but Udayavarma was able to meet
        every one of them. She soon discovered that he was a good swordsman and
        that she would not be able to subdue him so easily. Soon Sona was
        defeated by Udayavarma.She stopped the fight and joined her parents.
        Cheers rose from the audience who was watching the proceedings very
        eagerly. When Udayavarma came forward to present himself to the King and
        queen, Sona recognized him as the one who had cheered her in
        encouragement the other day.She asked Udayavarma and he confessed to it.
        Now Sona knew how he had succeeded in overpowering her. She came forward
        and said to him that "My condition was that I would marry anyone who
        would defeat me in the contest. Though you've defeated me, I can't marry
        you. You can yourself find out the reason." Udayavarma thought for a
        while and said . "Yes what you say is right, O Princess. I should not
        marry you." He bowed to her and left the palace. The king and queen were
        surprised over their daughter's decision as according to her contest
        Sona insisted that she would marry only that man who would defeat her in
        the fight and Udayavarma had achieved it , but now she was not ready to
        marry him and even Udayavarma, too, had meekly accepted her decision,
        saying he could not possibly claim her hand. How strange! They were
        unable to guess what really was the cause? The Betaal concluded the
        story and asked King Vikramaditya, 1) "O king ! I've some doubts.I think
        Sona was proud of herself that she was an expert in warfare and that's
        why she announced that she would marry only whoever defeated her, didn't
        she? 2) As she scored a victory over one prince after another, she was
        becoming more and more arrogant. 3) Then came Udayavarma who succeeded
        in overpowering her. Again it was her from keeping her word. 4) Why did
        she say he did not de serve her hand in marriage in spite of his victory
        over her? It was all because of her arrogance, wasn't it? If you know
        the answers to my questions that speak out if you don't then I warn you
        that "your head will be blown to pieces!"
