        <h1 align="center"><u> Matter of Succession</u></h1>
        <h1 align="center"><u>Successor is not only by relationship established </u></h1>
        
        Vaitaal said - "Now the time is very short, let me tell you one another story,
        may be the last one." Vikram said - "So you will complete 25 stories." "Yes,
        And these stories will be famous as "Vaitaal Pachcheesee". How much good I
        have done by telling you these stories, only the Time will tell. So listen to it
        attentively.
        There were two young men, Madan and Ratan, in Baatee island. Both were
        very fast friends. Once both went to do business together. They made a lot
        of profit. While returning, they sat down under a tree and started counting
        their remaining things and profit. They were busy in their work, that a
        beautiful woman came there.
        Both looked at her surprisingly and asked her - "O Beautiful, Who are you?"
        She told the she was going with her husband that some robbers robbed them
and killed her husband. After saying this she broke into tears and started
crying loudly. She said - "Since now there is nobody for me to go - there
was no use to go to my parents and other relations, I will commit suicide."
Madan and Ratan consoled her and assured her to provide every kind of help
she needed. Woman got consoled. Their work was over so they took her along
and started their journey. Both were thinking about her, as what to do of
her.
Madan suggested that she should be remarried. Ratan said - "Maybe one of us
can marry her." "But how?" Ratan said - "If you are interested, you may
marry her." Madan said - "Yes, I can marry, but if you want, you can marry
her." Madan again said - "Look, We both are interested to marry her. So, let
us play the dice game and decide who will marry her. Then we will not have
any complaint with each other." Ratan agreed.
Then both sat again under a tree, and played dice game for a long time. In
the end, the match was drawn. They again started playing, but again the
match was drawn. They did this several times, but nobody won the game,
nobody lost the game. So they were unable to decide what to do. Then they
asked her - "To whom you want to marry." She shyly told that she could
marry both of them, because she liked both of them.
Now they were in real trouble. That woman was still with them. In the end
they thought to pick the paper. They wrote their names on two papers and
picked one. It was Madan's name, so Madan married her.
Vikram, see the Time, after a child was born to them, Madan died in an
accident. The woman asked Madan's share of wealth from Ratan. Although
Madan had no partnership with Ratan, still she asked his share from Ratan.
Now tell Vikram, how far her demand was lawful?
Vikram said - "The matter must have gone to the royal court." Vaitaal said -
"Yes, And I know the judgment also. The king refused her claim, but what is
you judgment?" Vikram smiled - "My judgment? My judgment is that she
should get it." "Why?" Vikram said - "It was true that Madan had won her by
toss, but still she was the property of both of them. She had the right of
succession."
Vaitaal said - "You are right, Vikram." He again laughed loudly. As Vaitaal
lughed loudly Vikram became careful and he held him tightly, because now his
destination was very near. Vaitaal said - "Don't worry, I will not run away
now. I am with you." But Vikram didn't trust him so he held him tightly.
