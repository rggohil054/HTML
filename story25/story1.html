            <p>
              The stories of TALES OF KING VIKRAM AND BETAAL THE VAMPIRE is an
              icon of Indian storey telling, a brain teaser. Although there are
              32 stories 25 are covered in Betal Panchisi. I will be sharing
              with you shortly, some of the stories that are available with me.
              I am sure, after some time my colleague will definitely let me
              know the stories which I could not lay hand and help me in
              deavoring my efforts.

          <font size="5">
            <p>
              A very famous account of human and vetal interaction is chronicled
              in the Baital Pancsihi ('Twenty Five Tales Of The Vampire) which
              consist of twenty five tales chronicling the adventures of King
              Vikramaditya and how his wits were pitted against a vetal a
              sorcerer had asked him to capture for him. Vetals have great
              wisdom and insight into the human soul in addition to being able
              to see into the past and future and are thus very valuable
              acquisitions to wise men.
            </p>
            <p>
              This particular vetal inhabited a tree in a crematorium/graveyard
              and the only way it could be captured was by standing still and
              completely silent in the middle of the graveyard/crematorium.
              However, every single time the king tried this vetal would tempt
              him with a story that ended in a question the answering of which
              King Vikramaditya could not resist. As a result the vetal would
              re-inhabit the tree and the king was left to try again. Only after
              relating twenty five tales does the vetal allow the king to bear
              him back to the sorcerer, hence the name Baital Pancsihi.The vetal
              informs the king of the treacherous sorcerers' true intentions.
              The sorcerer means to trick Vikramaditya, possessor of thirty two
              virtues, and sacrifice him to a Goddess which would give him
              control over the vetal and his kind.
            </p>
            <p>
              The vetal advises the king to ask the sorcerer how to pay his
              respects to the Goddess (which the sorcerer would ask him to do
              and use this opportunity to sacrifice him) and behead him while he
              is distracted. On following the vetal's advice the king is blessed
              and granted a boon by Lord Indra. The king wishes2 the sorcerer to
              come back to life and wishes that henceforth he would have the
              help and advice of the vetal whenever he needed it.The Baital
              Pansihi was originally written in Sanskrit and is said to be the
              inspiration for the Arabian Nights and subsequent collections of
              fantastic mythological tales.
