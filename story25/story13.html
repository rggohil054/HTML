                   <h1 align="center"><u>The Marvellous Delicacy of Three Queens.</u></h1>  
                   
                   The Baital said, O king, in the Gaur country, Vardhman by name, there is a
                   city, and one called Gunshekhar was the Raja of that land. His minister was
                   one Abhaichand, a Jain, by whose teachings the king also came into the Jain
                   faith.
                   The worship of Shiva and of Vishnu, gifts of cows, gifts of lands, gifts of
                   rice balls, gaming and spirit-drinking, all these he prohibited. In the city no
                   38
                   man could get leave to do them, and as for bones, into the Ganges no man was
                   allowed to throw them, and in these matters the minister, having taken orders
                   from the king, caused a proclamation to be made about the city, saying,
                   "Whoever these acts shall do, the Raja having confiscated, will punish him and
                   banish him from the city."
                   Now one day the Diwan[169] began to say to the Raja, "O great king, to the
                   decisions of the Faith be pleased to give ear. Whosoever takes the life of
                   another, his life also in the future birth is taken: this very sin causes him to
                   be born again and again upon earth and to die And thus he ever continues to
                   be born again and to die. Hence for one who has found entrance into this
                   world to cultivate religion is right and proper. Be pleased to behold! By love,
                   by wrath, by pain, by desire, and by fascination overpowered, the gods
                   Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahadeva (Shiva) in various ways upon the earth are ever
                   becoming incarnate. Far better than they is the Cow, who is free from
                   passion, enmity, drunkenness, anger, covetousness, and inordinate affection,
                   who supports mankind, and whose progeny in many ways give ease and solace to
                   the creatures of the world These deities and sages (munis) believe in the
                   Cow.[170]
                   "For such reason to believe in the gods is not good. Upon this earth be
                   pleased to believe in the Cow. It is our duty to protect the life of everyone,
                   beginning from the elephant, through ants, beasts, and birds, up to man. In
                   the world righteousness equal to that there is none. Those who, eating the
                   flesh of other creatures, increase their own flesh, shall in the fulness of time
                   assuredly obtain the fruition of Narak [17l]; hence for a man it is proper to
                   attend to the conversation of life. They who understand not the pain of other
                   creatures, and who continue to slay and to devour them, last but few days in
                   the land, and return to mundane existence, maimed, limping, one-eyed, blind,
                   dwarfed, hunchbacked, and imperfect in such wise. Just as they consume the
                   bodies of beasts and of birds, even so they end by spoiling their own bodies.
                   From drinking spirits also the great sin arises, hence the consuming of spirits
                   and flesh is not advisable."
                   The minister having in this manner explained to the king the sentiments of his
                   own mind, so brought him over to the Jain faith, that whatever he said, so
                   the king did. Thus in Brahmans, in Jogis, in Janganis, in Sevras, in
                   Sannyasis,[172] and in religious mendicants, no man believed, and according to
                   this creed the rule was carried on.
                   39
                   Now one day, being in the power of Death, Raja Gunshekhar died. Then his
                   son Dharmadhwaj sat upon the carpet (throne), and began to rule. Presently
                   he caused the minister Abhaichand to be seized, had his head shaved all but
                   seven locks of hair, ordered his face to be blackened, and mounting him on an
                   ass, with drums beaten, had him led all about the city, and drove him from
                   the kingdom. From that time he carried on his rule free from all anxiety.
                   It so happened that in the season of spring, the king Dharmadhwaj, taking his
                   queens with him, went for a stroll in the garden, where there was a large tank
                   with lotuses blooming within it. The Raja admiring its beauty, took off his
                   clothes and went down to bathe.
                   After plucking a flower and coming to the bank, he was going to give it into
                   the hands of one of his queens, when it slipped from his fingers, fell upon her
                   foot, and broke it with the blow. Then the Raja being alarmed, at once came
                   out of the tank, and began to apply remedies to her.
                   Hereupon night came on, and the moon shone brightly: the falling of its rays
                   on the body of the second queen formed blisters And suddenly from a distance
                   the sound of a wooden pestle came out of a householder's dwelling, when the
                   third queen fainted away with a severe pain in the head
                   Having spoken thus much the Baital said "O my king! of these three which is
                   the most delicate?" The Raja answered, "She indeed is the most delicate who
                   fainted in consequence of the headache." The Baital hearing this speech, went
                   and hung himself from the very same tree, and the Raja, having gone there
                   and taken him down and fastened him in the bundle and placed him on his
                   shoulder, carried him away.

                   As Vikramaaditya walked away from the tree, Vaitaal was silent for some
                   distance, but then he again started speaking - "Listen now, To listen to your
                   40
                   justice I tell you a story. It is just to pass time, listen to it and do justice."
                   Vaitaal started his story and Vikram started listening quietly.
                   Vaitaal said - "There lived a princess in Avantee Desh. Her name was Shashi.
                   She was very beautiful. As she grew up, many proposals came for her, but the
                   king of Avantee was unable to decide to whom to marry his daughter. After a
                   while the princes themselves started coming to the king and ask his daughter's
                   hand.
                   One day it so happened that the king was sitting in his court, that his
                   gatekeeper informed him that the prince of Chol Desh wanted to see him. The
                   king called him with respect and asked the reason of his coming. He expressed
                   his desire to marry the princess. Chol Desh was a very mighty kingdom in
                   those times, so the king had to think about it. He said to him - "Please you
                   stay in our special guest house, we will consult the princess and then only we
                   can reply you. By the way what is your specialty?" The prince said - "I am a
                   good archer. I can shoot "Shabd-Vedhee" (shooting an arrow just only
                   listening by sound) arrow and I don't miss my target." And the prince was
                   sent to the guest house.
                   After this another prince, prince of Vaishaalee, came with the proposal. King
                   asked him also, "What is your specialty?" He said - "Nobody can can make a
                   cloth like me. I alone know how to make the best silken cloth." And he
                   presented a very good silken cloth to the king. All courtiers got stunned to see
                   the quality and softness of that cloth. That cloth was sent to the princess
                   and the prince was sent to the guest house.
                   After this another prince came with the marriage proposal, he was from Bang
                   Desh. His specialty was that he was very learned. He remembered all Ved,
                   Geetaa, Puraan etc books. Anybody could ask him anything from anywhere.
                   The king sent him too to guest house respectfully. Now came the prince of
                   Chedi Desh. On asking his specialty, he told that he knew all the body parts
                   and the princess will never be sick if she was married to him. He was also
                   sent to the guest house. Thus four princes gathered in king's palace as
                   suitors for the princess.
                   Now the king said to his daughter - "Dear daughter, Four princes have come
                   with the desire to marry you. Take this Varmaalaa and put it in the neck of
                   the prince you like most. The princess came to the guest house with the
                   41
                   Varmaalaa. Now tell to whom the princess should choose as her husband. If
                   you did not reply in spite of knowing, your skull will split into pieces." Vaitaal
                   got silent after telling this.
                   Vikram was also silent. He was walking fast and he had held Vaitaal tightly.
                   He knew that he had to reply, he could not be silent, so he said - "Listen O
                   Vaitaal, A man is a Braahman, or Kshatriya, or Vaishya, or Shoodra by his
                   Karm (actions) only not by his birth. So the princess should marry the prince
                   of Chol Desh because only he is a true Kshatriya; others are Vaishya,
                   Braahman and Shoodra respectively. Only a Kshatriya can be the appropriate
                   husband for a princess."
                   As Vikram broke his silence, Vaitaal said laughing - "You are right Vikram,
                   only a Kshatriya can be the appropriate husband for the princess." and saying
                   this he again ran away from the king's shoulder. Although the king was
                   attentive still he took some time to capture him. He again started walking
                   towards the cremation ground.
                   After a while Vaitaal said - "You are right, a man is Braahman, or Kshatriya,
                   or Vaishya, or Shoodra by his Karm only not by his birth, then who will be the
                   carrier of a dead body?" "Shoodra." And Vaitaal broke into laughter.
                   After a while, Vikram saw a fire burning at one side and a woman was crying.
                   Hearing this, Vikram stopped. Vaitaal said - "Don't stop, keep moving. This is
                   a lonely forest. Ghosts and vampires play games here. Don't even look at
                   that, just keep moving on." Vikram obeyed him and kept moving.
