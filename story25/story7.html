                   <h1 align="center"><u> The four boys who made a lion</u></h1>  
                 Once upon a time there lived four sons of a poor brahmin who taught them all the Vedas and the holy scriptures. On their parents death, they decided to go and stay with their mother's father. But on reaching there they found that they were unwelcome there and that their cousins were unreceptive to the brothers. Then the brothers decided to each go out into the world and learn a special skill and come back and meet at a common place after a while. So they dispersed and came back to the same place at the appointed time. Each told what he had learnt. The first one said, " I can create flesh of a creature from a single one of the creature". The second one said, " I know how to grow the hair and skin of a creature if it has flesh and bones." The third one said, "I can create the limbs of a creature if its form is complete with skin hair and flesh and bones". The fourth one said, " I know how to give life to that creature once it is complete in form with limbs". 
                So they set off into the forest to find a piece of bone on which they could test their skills. The first one they found was a lion's. So each of them displayed his skill and created a live huge Lion, which as fate would have it, killed all four of them and sped away. 
                Betaal stops and asks King Vikram asks this question: Who among the four brothers is responsible for the death of all of them? Vikram replies with a lot of thought, "The fourth one, as he was the one who gave life to the otherwise dead structure of bones flesh and limbs and hair"  
                As soon as Vikram had finished his answer, Betaal disappeared back to the tree.

                   <h1 align="center"><u>The three sensitive queens</u></h1>  
                Once upon a time there lived a king of Ujjayani by name of Dharmadhvaja, who had three exquisitely sensitive queens. He loved all three of them very much, all of them were of unparalleled beauty.  
                On one occasion, while the king was playing with the first queen, he ruffled her hair. The lotus flower on her ear fell over her thigh, and made a wound and she cried out loud. The king was surprised at her sensitivity and immediately requested medical attention for her. 
                On another occasion, when he was with the second queen on a full moon night on the roof of his palace, the queen suddenly felt her skin burning of the moonlight. The king ordered medical attention for her too and was again surprised at her sensitivity. 
                On third occasion, when he was with the third queen, she collpased on the floor on hearing of the sound of a mortar grinding rice, far far away. The king immediately ordered medical attention for her and was surprised too. 
                Since then he took utmost care of his three ultra sensitive queens. 
                Betaal stops and asks King Vikram asks this question: Who among the three queens is the most sensitive? Vikram replies with a lot of thought, "The third one, as she had not even been touched by the light or flower. She had only heard a noise from distance."  
                As soon as Vikram had finished his answer, Betaal disappeared back to the tree .
