                    <p>
                        In days gone by, Vikramaditya, a great king ruled over a
                        prosperous kingdom from his capital at Ujjain. Mighty as the sun - he was a
                        king with immense love for learning as well as for adventure. King Vikram sat
                        in his court for hours every day, rewarding the virtuous, punishing the evil
                        doers, and encouraging scholars, poets, musicians, and artists. During such
                        sessions, numerous people came to meet him. They brought for him gifts of
                        jewels, gold or other precious things. Among such visitors was a mendicant
                        who, on every visit, presented the king with a fruit. The king accepted his
                        humble gift with the same show of courtesy with which he would have accepted a
                        diamond from a rich merchant. He used to hand over the fruit to the royal
                        storekeeper. One morning, the mendicant gave him his usual gift just when the
                        king was going out to inspect his stables. The king accepted the fruit all
                        right and went out while playing with it, tossing it up and then catching it
                        as it came down. It so happened that after a while the fruit fell down from
                        his hand. Instantly a monkey who was on a nearby tree swooped down upon it and
                        tried to crack it with his teeth. The fruit broke and pop came out a handy
              ball of ruby. The king's surprise knew no bounds. He picked up the ruby and
              sent for an expert. He examined it and said it was the finest ruby he had ever
              seen. "What did you do with all the fruits I have been giving you?" the
              anxious king asked of his store-keeper. "My lord, I threw them all into our
              store through the window!" replied the store-keeper. The king ordered him to
              fetch them, and when they were produced before him, he was further astonished
              and delighted to see that each one of the fruits contained a precious ruby.
              When the mendicant came the next day, the king gave all attention to him and
              asked him: "Why have you bestowed so much kindness on me?" "To be frank, I
              expect you to help me in a very important work of mine, O king, but of that
              I'll tell you in confidence," replied the mendicant. The king led him into the
              private audience chamber. The mendicant then said: â€œI know how brave you are.
              Hence I will ask you to do something which requires courage. But, for that,
              you must meet me under a Banyan tree in the center of the cremation ground
              beyond the city, at night, on the 14th day of the dark half of the month."
              Vikram hesitated for a while. But the spirit of adventure got the better of
              him. He agreed to meet the mendicant at the appointed hour. It was a dark
              night with a terrible gale blowing. When Vikram approached the cremation
              ground, he was received by the howling foxes and jackals. As he made his way
              through the ground, he saw in the flashes from lightning fearful faces of
              ghouls and ghosts staring at him or dancing around him. But undaunted, Vikram
              reached the banyan tree. The mendicant was delighted to see him. "Now, what's
              the work you want me to perform?" asked the king. "At the northern-most corner
              of this ground stands a very ancient tree. You will see a corpse hanging from
              one of its branches. Go and fetch it for me. I am seeking certain occult
              powers which I will get only if a king brings this particular corpse to me and
              if I practice certain rites sitting on it," disclosed the mendicant. To fetch
              a corpse that hung on a distant tree in that stormy night was not at all a
              pleasing task. But King Vikram braved the weather and the darkness as well as
              the menacing yells and shrieks of ghosts and ghouls and soon reached the old
              tree. Raising a burning torch he found the corpse hanging. He climbed the tree
              and with a stroke of his sword cut the rope with which the corpse had been
              tied to the branch. The corpse fell to the ground, and gave out an eerie cry.
              Vikram, not knowing that the corpse was possessed by a spirit, thought that
              the fellow was alive. He came down and lifted up the body lying sprawled on
              the ground. At that the corpse began to laugh. Surprised, the king asked: "Why
              do you laugh?" No sooner had the king opened his mouth than the corpse slipped
              away from his hands and hung on to the tree by itself. Six times did King
              Vikram bring it down and six times the corpse gave him the slip. At last
              Vikram realized that the corpse did the mischief only when he talked. On the
              seventh time Vikram put the corpse on his shoulder and began walking quietly.
              He had gone only a few steps when the corpse which, in fact, was a vampire,
              said: "O King, tiresome is the way. Let me tell you a tale to keep you
              amused!"
