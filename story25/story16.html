                        Only jeweler knows the value of gems
                        After a while Vaitaal said - "I am very happy with you Vikram, now I tell you
                        another surprising story. It is a real incident. I have witnessed it. There lived
                        a king, named Chandraveer, in the city of Chandrahridaya. He was a very
                        mighty king. He took a good care of his people. A rich man also lived in the
same city, his name was Dharmveer. He had daughter, her name was
Shobhanaa. She was very beautiful. Her father wanted to marry her, but she
had told him that whenever she would like any boy, she would tell him herself.
Dharmveer didn't speak anything after that.
Now, a day came that thefts started taking place in that city, but the thief
was not caught. Then the people requested Chandraveer. He sent all his
soldiers on vigilance, but still the thefts could not be stopped. People doubted
that the soldiers were with thieves. People again went to Chandraveer. This
time Chandraveer decided to vigil himself. This made his soldiers also honest.
After 3-4 days, when Chandraveer was roaming in the streets of the city, he
saw a man running away. "Go, and catch him." He ordered his soldiers.
Soldiers followed him and caught him. He was found with stolen goods. He
accepted that he was stealing till now and he was the thief. Next day it was
announced that the thief has been caught and he will be hanged tomorrow
after giving him a round of the city.
People got very happy to hear this news. Next day when the thief was taken
for the round in the city, all people came out to see him. When the thief was
passing in front of Dharmveer's house, Shobhanaa also saw him. She got
attracted to the thief. She immediately went to her father and told him that
she wanted to marry him and he should be saved. Dharmveer got stunned to
hear this. He tried to explain her but she did not listen to.
Shobhanaa said - "I have chosen him my husband. If he was hanged I will
become Satee with him." Hearing this he went to the king and requested him
to free the thief. The king got surprised to hear this, he said - "What are
you saying? How can it be possible? The thief has to be punished, otherwise
what my people will say?" Dharmveer came back home disappointed. Shobhanaa
was adamant on her decision. Dharmveer tried to explain to her but she didn't
listen to it.
This news spread all over the city. The thief also heard this. When he heard
it, he started weeping. Then the time came to hang him. The whole city was
present there. The thief was brought at the place where he was to be
hanged. The then Shobhanaa also came there. She announced that she had
chosen the thief as her husband, that is why she would become Satee with
him. When the thief heard this he laughed. After that he was hanged. Hey
Raajan, Shobhanaa became Satee carrying his dead body in her laps. She kept
her promise.
I have seen this incident myself, still I am not able to understand that why
the thief first wept hearing the news of Shobhanaa's love; and why did he
laugh at hearing Shobhanaa's becoming Satee with him. In fact it should have
been otherwise. He should have laughed at the first time and wept at the
second time.
Vikram said - "Vaitaal, Only the jeweler knows the value of gems. When the
thief came to know that the rich man's daughter Shobhanaa loved him, he
wept, because he thought, if this had happened before, he could be reformed;
second time he laughed because of the foolishness of Shobhanaa. He knew
that it was only a part of her womanish character."
Vikram got silent after saying this. He had held Vaitaal tightly that suddenly
Vaitaal laughed heartily in that dark night and said - "You are right, Vikram."
and ran away from his shoulder. Vikram again pulled Vaitaal from the tree,
put him on his shoulder and started walking. He said - "If you will runaway
like this, I will cut your head." Vaitaal again laughed and said - "No Vikram,
You cannot do this, because if you will cut my neck then what will you take to
that Yogee?" and he again ran away. Vikram went away to that Yogee without
taking Vaitaal.

The true obligation is without self motive
Vikram pulled Vaitaal from the tree, put him on his shoulder and continued his
journey. Vaitaal said - "Vikram, You are really working hard. Every time I run
away, and every time you take me to that Yogee. You don't feel bored, that
is why I tell you a story, listen--
A king, named Jeemootvaahan, lived in Himaachal Pradesh. He was very
religious, but his son Agnivaahan was very cruel. Agnivaahan expressed his
desire of becoming king while his father was alive. He threatened him to
forcefully descend him frm the throne if his desire was not fulfilled.
Jeemootvaahan handed over his kingdom to his son Agnivaahan and went away
to forest.
Agnivaahan started many atrocities with his people. Jeemootvaahan was
passing his life doing Tapasyaa. One day when he was singing Bhajan, he heard
a cry of an old woman. He went to that woman and asked the reason of her
crying. She said - "I have only one son. Here lives a Daanav, he will eat my
son tonight." Jeemootvaahan consoled her and said - "Don't be so sad,
mother. I will be very happy if my this body comes in use for somebody. I will
become your son and will become the food of that Daanav." The old woman
could not agree at this, but the king was firm on his decision, so she had to
agree at last.
In the evening the woman's son came back. She told him everything. Her son
also didn't agree for this, and he asked king to go back, but the king flatly
refused to go back, and somehow he made him agreed. Thus Jeemootvaahan
became the food of the Daanav and the woman's son was saved. Now tell me,
what kind of obligation was this?
Vikram thought for a while then said - "There is no obligation in this,
Vaitaal." "What? You mean that Jeemootvaahan's obligation went waste?" "No
Vaitaal, He did a great obligation on the woman, but O Vaitaal, the real
obligation is that which is unselfish. Jeemootvaahan sacrificed himself with the
desire of Moksh and Punya. Who could not do anything for his own son, if he
does something for the other's son, this is not logical. Jeemootvaahan should
have given up his life instead of making his son king. He handed over his
kingdom to a cruel person to rule and left his people to suffer under him, he
cannot be pardoned for this. This is my justice - you think yourself."
Vaitaal got silent hearing Vikram. After a while he spoke - "You are right,
Vikram." Then he laughed heartily, ran away from his shoulder and hung from
the same tree. Vikram again pulled Vaitaal from the tree, put him on his
shoulder and started walking.
