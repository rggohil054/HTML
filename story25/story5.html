       <h1 align="center"><u> The Three suitors</u></h1> Once upon a time there was born a beautiful daughter,
      Mandaravati, to a very famours priest. When the daughter grew of age, the
      father was worried about her marriage.Once, three eligible bachelors came
      to the father and each asked him for the hand of the daughter. Each of
      them threatened to kill himself lest the daughter be married off to any
      other of the three. The father decided not to marry her off to anyone. One
      day, she caught a very high pitched fever and died suddenly. All three of
      them, grief-struck, cremated the body of Mandaravati. One of them decided
      to stay there and slept on the ashes of Mandaravati. The other took her
      bones and went to the Ganges. The third became an ascetic and wandered
      off. On one of his wanderings, the third one reached a brahmin's house.
      The brahmin, by power of a spell, was able to bring the dead alive from
      the ashes. This was in a book which the brahmin gaurded safely. But the
      third suitor, in the stealth of night, stole this book and went back to
      the cremation ground of Mandaravati. The second one had returned from the
      Ganges with the holy water, and the first one was still there sleeping on
      the ashes. Then he with the help of the other two, recited the spell from
      the book and lo Behold!! Mandaravati was reborn! Then the three of them
      started fighting about whose wife she should be. Each of them claiming the
      revival being due to his effort Betaal stops and asks King Vikram asks
      this question: Who among the three suitors should be the husband of
      Mandaravati? Vikram replies with a lot of thought, "The person who gave
      her the life by reciting the spell is her creator, it could be her father.
      The person who took her bones to Ganges shall be her son. But the person
      who committed himself to the ground and slept on her ashes out of love,
      can be her husband." As soon as Vikram had finished his answer, Betaal
      disappeared back to the tree.
