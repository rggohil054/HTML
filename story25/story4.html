            <h2 align="center"><u>The exchanged heads</u></h2> Once upon a time there lived a washerman named
            Dhavala. He once spotted a very beautiful lady at pond, who happened
            to be the daughter of another washerman. He instantly fell in love
            with her and pleaded with his parents to ask her parents for her
            hand in marriage. His parents did accordingly and the girl,
            Madanasundari, got married to him with her parents consent. She then
            went with Dhavala to live with him. Once the brother of
            Madanasundari, came to Dhavala to invite his sister and
            brother-in-law to their place for festival season. Dhavala agreed
            and the three of them were returning to Madanasundari's home. On the
            way they happened to pass by the temple of Durga Devi, the all
            powerful goddess of power. Her brother wanted to pay a visit to the
            goddess, and went to the temple. But as soon as he came near the
            goddess, he wanted to make a massive sacrifice to the goddess. So
            saying he cut his head off for the goddess. Madanasundari was
            worried and she then sent her husband to see what the matter was. On
            seeing the state of his brother-in-law, the husband was also moved
            deeply and he decided to offer his own head too to the goddess and
            cut his own head with hisscitmar. Madanasundari, after a long wait came and saw both her brother and husband lying on the ground and then decided to take her own life but asked the goddesss to get the same brother and husband in the next life. The goddess was pleased and stopped her from dying and asked her to join their heads and bodies and then she granted them life. In a hurry, Madanasundari, exchanged the heads of her brother and husband and was perplexed. 
            Betaal stops and asks King Vikram asks this question: Who among the two is the husband of Madanasundari? Vikram replies with a lot of thought, "The body that carries her husband's head is is her husband. The head is the most important part of the human body, and the rest of the body is identified by the head." 
            As soon as Vikram had finished his answer, Betaal disappeared back to the tree.
